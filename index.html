        <img id="my-picture" src="" alt="Picture of me.">

        <p>My name's Josiah. I'm 26 years old. I'm currently focused on learning ever-changing field of web-development.</p>

        <p>
            I've worked with computers for as long as I can remember; my dad has always worked in the tech field, so I leared some 
            computing even in a young age. I even have some experience on the hardware side of things, in 2012, I built my own computer.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also like rocket science, have an intrest in investing and finance, and occasionally like to go camping. I'm currently 
            working on developing a healthier diet, and a consistant exercise schedule. Like investing, the hardest part of getting a 
            consistant exercise schedule, is the initial push. Once you make enough progress, it gets easier to continue.
