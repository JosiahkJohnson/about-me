            <p>My name's Josiah. I'm 26 years old. I'm currently focused on learning ever-changing field of web-development.</p>

            <p>
                I've worked with computers for as long as I can remember; my dad has always worked in the tech field, so I leared some 
                computing even in a young age. I even have some experience on the hardware side of things, in 2012, I built my own computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also like rocket science, have an intrest in investing and finance, and occasionally like to go camping. I'm currently 
                working on developing a healthier diet, and a consistant exercise schedule. Like investing, the hardest part of getting a 
                consistant exercise schedule, is the initial push. Once you make enough progress, it gets easier to continue.
